Summary
Background Despite recent advances in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, there remains a need  for eﬀ ective treatments for progressive disease. We assessed the eﬃ  cacy of pembrolizumab for patients with  previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
Methods We did this randomised, open-label, phase 2/3 study at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries. Patients  with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumour cells were randomly  assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six per stratum with an interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab  2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, or docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints were overall survival  and progression-free survival both in the total population and in patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of  tumour cells. We used a threshold for signiﬁ cance of p<0·00825 (one-sided) for the analysis of overall survival and a  threshold of p<0·001 for progression-free survival. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01905657.
Findings Between Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we enrolled 1034 patients: 345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg,  346 allocated to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 allocated to docetaxel. By Sept 30, 2015, 521 patients had died. In  the total population, median overall survival was 10·4 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 12·7 months with  pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 8·5 months with docetaxel. Overall survival was signiﬁ cantly longer for pembrolizumab  2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·58–0·88; p=0·0008) and for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg  versus docetaxel (0·61, 0·49–0·75; p<0·0001). Median progression-free survival was 3·9 months with pembrolizumab  2 mg/kg, 4·0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4·0 months with docetaxel, with no signiﬁ cant diﬀ erence  for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0·88, 0·74–1·05; p=0·07) or for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus  docetaxel (HR 0·79, 95% CI 0·66–0·94; p=0·004). Among patients with at least 50% of tumour cells expressing  PD-L1, overall survival was signiﬁ cantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median  14·9 months vs 8·2 months; HR 0·54, 95% CI 0·38–0·77; p=0·0002) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with  docetaxel (17·3 months vs 8·2 months; 0·50, 0·36–0·70; p<0·0001). Likewise, for this patient population, progression- free survival was signiﬁ cantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 5·0 months vs  4·1 months; HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·44–0·78; p=0·0001) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel  (5·2 months vs 4·1 months; 0·59, 0·45–0·78; p<0·0001). Grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events were less  common with pembrolizumab than with docetaxel (43 [13%] of 339 patients given 2 mg/kg, 55 [16%] of 343 given  10 mg/kg, and 109 [35%] of 309 given docetaxel).
Interpretation Pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival and has a favourable beneﬁ t-to-risk proﬁ le in patients with  previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. These data establish pembrolizumab as a  new treatment option for this population and validate the use of PD-L1 selection.

Introduction
Although treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer has  improved in recent years with the development of  targeted drugs for patients with amenable mutations,1–5  only a small proportion of patients have these mutations,  and most  tumours become resistant  to  targeted  treatment.6 Immunotherapy is a new paradigm for the  treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and targeting  the PD-1 pathway is a promising therapeutic option.7–11  The PD-1 receptor is an immune checkpoint inhibitor 
expressed on activated B and T cells that normally down- modulates excessive immune responses.12,13 Binding of  PD-1 to its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) on tumour cells  suppresses T cells through a negative feedback loop,  leading to evasion of the immune response.14–17 Pembrolizumab (MK-3475)  is a highly selective,  humanised, IgG4 monoclonal antibody against PD-1.  Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg given once every 3 weeks was  granted accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment  of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer

Panel: Research in context
Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on Nov 2, 2015, using the following terms:  “PD-1 OR PD-L1 OR MK-3475 OR pembrolizumab OR  lambrolizumab OR Keytruda OR nivolumab OR BMS-936558 OR  Opdivo OR atezolizumab OR MPDL3280A OR BMS-936559 OR  durvalumab OR MEDI4736 OR avelumab OR MSB0010718C OR  docetaxel” AND “non-small-cell lung cancer OR NSCLC”. The  search was not limited by date. We also searched the abstracts for  the 2014 and 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual  Meetings, the 2014 European Society for Medical Oncology  Congress, and the 2015 European Cancer Congress using the same  search terms. We identiﬁ ed three randomised trials of anti-PD-1 or  anti-PD-L1 treatment versus docetaxel for non-small-cell lung  cancer: the CheckMate 017 study of nivolumab for squamous non- small-cell lung cancer, the CheckMate 057 study of nivolumab for  non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, and the POPLAR study  of atezolizumab for squamous and non-squamous non-small-cell  lung cancer. We focused on the CheckMate studies because they  are published in peer-reviewed journals.
Added value of this study Results of KEYNOTE-010 conﬁ rm the eﬃ  cacy and safety of PD-1  inhibition with pembrolizumab in patients with previously 
treated non-small-cell lung cancer. These data are the ﬁ rst  published report of a randomised, controlled clinical trial of  non-small-cell lung cancer that prospectively shows the utility  of PD-L1 as a biomarker. This study is also the ﬁ rst of a PD-1  inhibitor for non-small-cell lung cancer to include patients who  received more than one line of previous treatment. Both  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every  3 weeks provided superior overall survival compared with  docetaxel, with similar outcomes for each pembrolizumab  dose. Pembrolizumab was also associated with fewer  high-grade toxic eﬀ ects than was docetaxel.
Implications of all the available evidence Our data support pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg given every 3 weeks  as a new treatment option for patients with non-small-cell  lung cancer with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of at least  1% that progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and,  in those with an EGFR sensitising mutation or an ALK  translocation, an appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These  data also validate the use of PD-L1 on tumour cells as a  biomarker to identify patients most likely to obtain a beneﬁ t  from pembrolizumab. 
whose tumours express PD-L1 (as determined by test  approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) with  disease progression during or after platinum-containing  chemotherapy. This approval was based on data from  550 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer enrolled in  the large, multicohort, phase 1b KEYNOTE-001 study.9,18  In KEYNOTE-001, a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of  50% or greater, deﬁ ned as PD-L1 expression on at least  50% of tumour cells (appendix p 5), was associated with  better outcomes.9 We present results of KEYNOTE-010,  the ﬁ rst  randomised comparison of pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or  10 mg/kg every 3 weeks versus standard-of-care treatment  for PD-L1-positive non-small-cell  lung cancer  that  progressed after at least platinum-based chemotherapy.  This study is the ﬁ rst active-control trial that enrolled  patients on the basis of prospective assessment of  tumour PD-L1 expression based on the association  between higher PD-L1 expression and greater clinical  beneﬁ t from pembrolizumab.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial  at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries (Argentina,  Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic,  Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan,  Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, South Africa,  South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, UK, and USA). We included  patients aged at least 18 years, with progression as per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST;  version 1.1)19 after two or more cycles of platinum-doublet  chemotherapy, as well as an appropriate tyrosine kinase  inhibitor for those with an EGFR-sensitising mutation or  ALK gene rearrangement; measurable disease as per  investigator-assessed RECIST; an Eastern Cooperative  Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; provision of  a tumour sample; and PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of  tumour cells (ie, a tumour proportion score ≥1%). Initially,  any tumour sample was permitted for PD-L1 testing. The  study protocol was later amended to require a new tumour  sample for PD-L1 testing except when attempting to take a  biopsy would be too risky. To be considered a new sample,  no intervening treatment was permitted between the time  the sample was taken and initiation of study treatment.  The only exception was that patients receiving tyrosine  kinase inhibitors before the biopsy was taken were  permitted to resume them after sample collection.  456 patients were enrolled on the basis of archival samples. Key exclusion criteria were previous treatment with  PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel, known active  brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis, active  autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids, and  interstitial lung disease or history of pneumonitis  requiring systemic steroids. The appendix shows all the  inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study protocol and all amendments were approved  by the appropriate institutional review boards and ethics  committees at each institution. The study was done in  accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice

Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) with a central  interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab  2 mg/kg intravenously over 30 min every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg  intravenously over 30 min every 3 weeks, or docetaxel  75 mg/m² intravenously over 1 h every 3 weeks. The 
allocation schedule was generated by the system vendor  using a computerised randomised list generator. Patients  were stratiﬁ ed by Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group  performance status (0 vs 1) and region (east Asia vs not east  Asia). A third stratiﬁ cation variable, extent of PD-L1  expression (tumour proportion score ≥50% vs 1–49%), was  added after 441 patients were allocated and the PD-L1  immuno histochemistry assay cutpoint was established.9  Treatment was allocated in blocks of six in each stratum.

Table 1: Baseline characteristics
4–6 weeks later. Per protocol, patients in the docetaxel  group were not permitted to cross over to receive  pembrolizumab. Radiographic imaging was done every 9 weeks.  Response was assessed as per RECIST version 1.1 by  independent central review (for eﬃ  cacy) and as per  immune-related response criteria by investigator (to  inform treatment decisions). Adverse events were graded  according to the National Cancer Institute Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0).  PD-L1 expression was assessed at a central laboratory  with an immunohistochemistry assay (Dako; Carpinteria,  CA, USA) with the murine 22C3 anti-human PD-L1  antibody (Merck; Kenilworth, NJ, USA), as previously  described (appendix p 5).9
Outcomes
The primary endpoints were overall survival (time from  randomisation  to death due  to any cause) and  progression-free survival (time from randomisation to  radiologically conﬁ rmed progressive disease or death  due to any cause) both in the total population (ie, tumour  proportion score of 1% or greater) and in patients with  tumour proportion score of 50% or greater. Secondary  endpoints were safety, response rate (percentage of  patients with complete or partial response as per RECIST  version 1.1), and duration of response (time from ﬁ rst  evidence of response until disease progression or death). We did prespeciﬁ ed subgroup analyses of age, sex,  Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group performance  status, EGFR mutation status, and age of tumour sample.  We also did post-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses of  tumour histology. We analysed overall survival, progression-free survival,  and response rate in the intention-to-treat population 
and we analysed duration of response for all patients who  had a best overall response of complete or partial  response according to RECIST (version 1.1) by central  review; we assessed safety in all patients who received at  least one dose of study treatment. After one patient was  allocated to and received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, it was  found that their pre-baseline scans were not compliant  with the protocol. The patient was permitted to remain  on treatment and was included in the safety analysis  population, but because it would not be possible to  adequately assess tumour response, the patient was  excluded from the eﬃ  cacy analysis population.
Statistical analysis
Because the lowest eﬀ ective dose and the relative merit of  progression-free survival versus overall survival were  unknown and the importance of PD-L1 staining was being  validated when this study was designed, we assessed four  primary outcomes at two doses. The two doses were  selected on the basis of pharmacological models, and the  statistical analysis plan appropriately accounted for the  multiple endpoints. Two prespeciﬁ ed interim analyses  were done by an unmasked statistician (appendix p 4).  The  data monitoring  committee  recommended  continuing the study as planned after both interim  analyses. This study was designed to show a diﬀ erence in  overall survival in patients with a tumour proportion score  of 50% or greater. Because we assumed that half of the  total sample would have a tumour proportion score of  50% or greater, we believed that an overall survival beneﬁ t  in this group would provide enough power to show a  beneﬁ t for all primary endpoints. The ﬁ nal analysis was  planned for when roughly 200 deaths occurred across all  treatment groups in patients with a tumour proportion  score of 50% or greater. Assuming that overall survival

Results
Between Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we screened  2699 patients for enrolment. Of the 2222 patients whose  tumour samples were assessable for PD-L1 expression,  1475 (66%) had PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of  tumour cells, including 633 (28%) with PD-L1 expression  on at least 50% of tumour cells. 1034 (70%) of 1475 patients  met the eligbility criteria and were enrolled in the study:  345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 to  pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 to docetaxel (ﬁ gure 1).  991 patients received at least one dose of assigned study  drug: 339 in the 2 mg/kg group, 343 in the 10 mg/kg  group, and 309 in the docetaxel group (ﬁ gure 1). At the  cutoﬀ  date of Sept 30, 2015, median follow-up was  13·1 months (IQR 8·6–17·7). Baseline characteristics were as expected for patients  with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and were  balanced between groups (table 1). Most patients were  current or former smokers, had tumours of non-
follows an exponential distribution with an expected  median of 9 months in the docetaxel group (based on  previous studies), a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·60 between  pem brolizumab and docetaxel, an enrolment period of  16 months, a minimum of 8 months of follow-up after  enrolment was complete to observe the required number  of events, and a dropout rate of 2% over 12 months, we  calculated that we would need to enrol 460 patients with a  tumour proportion score of 50% or greater to provide at  least 81% power to detect an HR of 0·55 for overall  survival, with a one-sided α of 0·00825 using the Hochberg  procedure. We expected that roughly 920 patients would  be enrolled in total and that 550 patients would die by the  ﬁ nal analysis, giving the study at least 80% power to detect  an HR of 0·70 for overall survival in the total population.  For the analysis of progression-free survival, we used a  threshold of p<0·001 for signiﬁ cance. The appendix (p 6)  shows the multiplicity strategy we applied to the stratum  of patients with a tumour proportion score of 50% or  greater and to the overall population. For overall survival, data for patients who were alive or  lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last conﬁ rmed  contact. For progression-free survival, data for patients  who had not progressed or were lost to follow-up were  censored at the time of last tumour assessment. For  duration of response, data for patients whose response was  ongoing at the time of the analysis or who discontinued  the study without radiological evidence of progression  were censored at the time of the last radiological  assessment showing response, data for patients who had  radiological disease progression after missing  two  radiological assessments were censored at the time of the  last radiological assessment showing response, and data  for patients who initiated new cancer treatment without  radiological evidence of disease progression were censored  at the time of starting their new treatment. We did the statistical analyses using SAS (version 9.3).  We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall  survival, progression-free survival, and duration of  response. We used the stratiﬁ ed log-rank test to assess  treatment diﬀ erences in progression-free survival and  overall survival; we used stratiﬁ ed Cox proportional  hazard models with Efron’s method of tie handling to  calculate HRs and associated 95% CIs.21 We compared  response rate between treatment groups with the  Miettinen and Nurminen method.22 All primary and  subgroup analyses were stratiﬁ ed with the randomisation  stratiﬁ cation factors. This study  is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  NCT01905657.

squamous histology, and had received one line of previous  systemic  treatment  (table 1). Few patients had  EGFR-mutant or ALK-translocated tumours. Baseline  characteristics were similar in the 442 patients who had a  PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 50% or greater (table 1). At the time of data cutoﬀ , 521 patients had died:  172 (50%) of 344 in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group,  156 (45%) of 346 in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group,  and 193 (56%) of 343 in the docetaxel group. 204 patents  with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 50% or greater  died: 58 (42%) of 139 in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg  group, 60 (40%) of 151 in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg  group, and 86 (57%) of 152 in the docetaxel group. After  discontinuation of study treatment, additional anti- neoplastic treatment was received by 138 (40%) of  344 patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group,  133 (38%) of 346 patients in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg  group, and 151 (44%) of 343 patients in the docetaxel  group, including two (1%), six (2%), and 45 (13%),  respectively, who received other  immunotherapies  (appendix pp 8–9). In patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of  50% or greater, the HR for overall survival for  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel was 0·54  (95% CI 0·38–0·77; p=0·0002), and for pembrolizumab  10 mg/kg versus docetaxel it was 0·50 (0·36–0·70;  p<0·0001). Median overall survival was 14·9 months  (95% CI 10·4–not reached) for the pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg group, 17·3 months (11·8–not reached) for the  pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 8·2 months  (6·4–10·7) for the docetaxel group (ﬁ gure 2A). In the total population, the HR for pembrolizumab  2 mg/kg versus docetaxel was 0·71 (95% CI 0·58–0·88;  p=0·0008) and the HR for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg  versus docetaxel was 0·61 (0·49–0·75; p<0·0001). Median  overall survival was 10·4 months (95% CI 9·4–11·9) for  the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 12·7 months  (10·0–17·3) for the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and  8·5 months (95% CI, 7·5–9·8) for the docetaxel group  (ﬁ gure 2B). 1-year overall survival was 43·2% versus  52·3% versus 34·6%. Overall survival was similar in the  two pembrolizumab groups both in patients with a PD-L1  tumour proportion score of 50% or greater (HR for  2 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg 1·12, 95% CI 0·77–1·62) and in the  total population  (1·17, 0·94–1·45). Pembrolizumab  provided beneﬁ t compared with docetaxel irrespective of  whether archival or new tumour samples were used to  assess PD-L1 expression. There was a signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t  for patients with non-squamous disease. For those with  squamous disease, the diﬀ erence was not statistically  signiﬁ cant, but the data suggest a clinical beneﬁ t in this  group also (ﬁ gure 3). 776 patients had died or had disease progression,  including 266 (77%) of 344 in the pembrolizumab  2 mg/kg group, 254 (73%) of 346 in the pembrolizumab  10 mg/kg group, and 256 (75%) of 343 in the docetaxel  group. In patients with a tumour proportion score of  50% or greater, 304 patients had a progression-free  survival event (89 [64%] of 139, 97 [64%] of 151, and 118  [78%] of 152, respectively). Progression-free survival was  signiﬁ cantly longer with pembrolizumab than with  docetaxel in patients with a tumour proportion score of  50% or greater (ﬁ gure 4A), with an HR of 0·59 (95% CI  0·44–0·78; p=0·0001) for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg  versus doxetaxel and 0·59 (0·45–0·78; p<0·0001) for  pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel. Median  progression-free survival was 5·0 months (95% CI  4·0–6·5)  in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group,  5·2 months (4·1–8·1) in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg  group, and 4·1 months (3·6–4·3) in the docetaxel group. For the total population, progression-free survival did  not meet the prespeciﬁ ed criterion for declaring statistical  signiﬁ cance between pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and  doxetaxel (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·74–1·05; p=0·07) or  between pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg and doxetaxel  (HR 0·79, 0·66–0·94; p=0·004). Median progression- free survival was 3·9 months (95% CI 3·1–4·1) in the  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 4·0 months (2·7–4·3) in  the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 4·0 months  (3·1–4·2) in the docetaxel group (ﬁ gure 4B). Progression- free survival was similar for each pembrolizumab dose  in patients with a tumour proportion score of 50% or  greater (HR 1·01, 95% CI 0·75–1·36) and in the total  population (1·09, 0·92–1·30). The eﬀ ect on progression- free survival did not diﬀ er by tumour histology (ﬁ gure 5).

score of 50% or greater—patients with high PD-L1  expression had an unprecedented beneﬁ t for refractory  non-small-cell lung cancer. Both pembrolizumab groups  had signiﬁ cantly improved progression-free survival in  patients with a tumour proportion score of 50% or greater,  and although the prespeciﬁ ed criterion for declaring  statistical signiﬁ cance was not met, progression-free  survival was longer with pembrolizumab than with  docetaxel  for  the  total population. Responses  to  pembrolizumab were durable, regardless of PD-L1  expression level. Pembrolizumab was associated with  fewer high-grade treatment-related adverse events than  was docetaxel, despite a longer exposure. Immune- mediated adverse events, including pneumonitis, occurred  at manageable rates, although three (<1%) of 682 patients  treated with pembrolizumab died because of pneumonitis. Median overall survival with docetaxel seemed to be  consistent with that previously reported (9 months),23  and there was no diﬀ erence in survival with docetaxel 
Among patients with a tumour proportion score of  50% or greater, responses occurred in 42 (30%) of  139 patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 44  (29%) of 151 in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and  12 (8%) of 152 in the docetaxel group (p<0·0001 for each  pembrolizumab group vs docetaxel; appendix p 10). In  the total population, 62 (18%) of 344 patients versus  64 (18%) of 346 patients versus 32 (9%) of 343 had  responses (p=0·0005 for 2 mg/kg vs docetaxel and  p=0·0002 for 10 mg/kg vs docetaxel; appendix p 10). All  responses were partial responses. Median time to  response was 9 weeks in each treatment group (appendix  p 10). Responses were longer in the pembrolizumab  groups than in the docetaxel group (appendix p 7), with a  median duration of response not reached for either  pembrolizumab group compared with 8 months in the  docetaxel group for patients with a tumour proportion  score of ≥50% or greater and 6 months in the docetaxel  group for all patients (appendix p 10). In the safety population, the median duration of  treatment was 3·5 months (IQR 1·4–7·2) in the  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 3·5 months (1·4–7·0) in  the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 2·0 months  (0·8–3·6) in the docetaxel group. Grade 3–5 adverse  events attributed to study treatment occurred in 43 (13%)  of 339 patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group,  55 (16%) of 343 patients in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg  group, and 109 (35%) of 309 patients in the docetaxel  group (table 2). 15 (4%) of 339 patients, 17 (5%) of  343 patients, and 31 (10%) of 309 patients, respectively,  permanently discontinued study drug because of  treatment-related adverse events. Deaths attributed to  study treatment occurred in three patients in the  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group  (two cases of  pneumonitis and one of pneumonia), three patients in  the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group (one case each of  myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and pneumonitis),  and ﬁ ve patients in the docetaxel group (one case each of  acute cardiac failure, dehydration, febrile neutropenia,  interstitial lung disease, and respiratory tract infection). Adverse events were as expected for pembrolizumab  and docetaxel (table 2, appendix pp 11–12). Adverse events  of special interest based on their likely immune aetiology,  irrespective of attribution to study treatment, occurred in  69 (20%) of 339 patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg  group and 64 (19%) of 343 patients in the pembrolizumab  10 mg/kg group. The most common of these events were  hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and pneumonitis  (table 2). The only adverse events of special interest of  grade 3–5 severity that occurred in 1% or more of patients  were pneumonitis and severe skin reactions (table 2).
Discussion
Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks met  the prespeciﬁ ed criteria for improved overall survival in  all patients  (ie, PD-L1  tumour proportion score  of 1% or greater) and in those with a tumour proportion

among patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of  50% or greater or in the total population. Consistent with  KEYNOTE-001,9 pembrolizumab eﬃ  cacy was greater in  patients with a tumour proportion score of 50% or  greater than in the overall population. Progression-free  survival with pembrolizumab was superior to that of  docetaxel in patients with a tumour proportion score of  50% or greater, but not in the total population. However,  overall survival with pembrolizumab was superior to that  of docetaxel in both tumour proportion score strata,  suggesting that progression-free survival might not  appropriately capture the true beneﬁ t of pembrolizumab.  The lack of a beneﬁ t for progression-free survival despite  a signiﬁ cant overall survival beneﬁ t was also reported in  the CheckMate 057 study of nivolumab versus docetaxel  for non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.8 Few patients assigned to pembrolizumab withdrew  consent, whereas the incidence in the docetaxel group  was higher than what is typical in a phase 3 trial. Many of  the patients allocated to docetaxel who withdrew consent  probably did so to seek anti-PD-1 treatment. A similarly  high percentage of patients in the CheckMate 057 trial  who were assigned to docetaxel did not receive it (22 [8%]  of 290).8 This ﬁ nding is not surprising given the many  other studies of PD-1 inhibitors for non-small-cell lung  cancer that were ongoing during KEYNOTE-010. Patients  who withdrew and subsequently received another  immunotherapy could aﬀ ect overall survival. However, 
any bias of this unplanned crossover would likely favour  the docetaxel group. Therefore, the high dropout rate in  the docetaxel group does not diminish our conﬁ dence in  the signiﬁ cant survival beneﬁ t for pembrolizumab.  Another limitation of this study is the incidence of EGFR  mutation or ALK translocation, which was lower than  would be expected in the general non-small-cell lung  cancer population. Finally, because we excluded patients  with no PD-L1 tumour expression, we could not do  statistically meaningful analyses of the interaction  between PD-L1 expression and outcome by treatment  allocation. Our results contribute to the growing evidence that  supports PD-1 pathway inhibition in non-small-cell lung  cancer.7,8,10,11,24 Although reports of  treatment with  pembrolizumab and nivolumab have shown a survival  beneﬁ t  for PD-1  inhibition, several aspects of  KEYNOTE-010 diﬀ erentiate it from the CheckMate 017  and CheckMate 057 studies of nivolumab.7,8 Whereas  there were separate nivolumab studies for squamous7  and non-squamous8 histology, KEYNOTE-010 enrolled  patients regardless of histology. Our data suggest that,  like nivolumab, pembrolizumab provides beneﬁ t for  squamous and non-squamous non-small-cell  lung  cancer (although the diﬀ erence for squamous cell  disease was not statistically signiﬁ cant, probably partly   because of the small population size). In addition,  whereas both CheckMate studies limited enrolment to  patients who received only one  line of previous  treatment for metastatic disease, almost one-third of  patients in KEYNOTE-010 received at least two lines of  previous treatment. Our data are the ﬁ rst reported for lung cancer  prospectively showing the utility of PD-L1 as a biomarker;  all patients derived a survival beneﬁ t from pembro- lizumab. This ﬁ nding contrasts with the ﬁ ndings of  studies of unselected populations. The assay used in  KEYNOTE-010 was rigorously evaluated and validated  before the study began9 and has been approved by the  Food and Drug Administration as a companion  diagnostic test. Our data indicate that assessment of  PD-L1 in archival samples with this assay is appropriate  because pembrolizumab provided superior overall  survival regardless of the age of the sample. Among  patients with evaluable samples screened for enrolment  in our study, two-thirds had a PD-L1 tumour proportion  score of 1% or greater, and more than a quarter had a  score of 50% or greater. The higher proportion of patients  with a score of 50% or greater in the enrolled population  (43%) was a result of the exclusion of patients with  PD-L1-negative  tumours. Whether  the beneﬁ t of  pembrolizumab extends to patients with a tumour  proportion score of less than 1% will require additional  study. Ongoing studies are assessing pembrolizumab  as ﬁ rst-line  therapy  (KEYNOTE-024, ClinicalTrials. gov number NCT02142738;  and KEYNOTE-042,  ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02220894) and as

adjuvant therapy (PEARLS, ClinicalTrials.gov number  NCT02504372). These studies are enrolling patients  using diﬀ erent biomarker cutpoints, and we await the  ﬁ nal analyses to determine which cutpoint best predicts  the eﬀ ectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy in  these earlier lines of therapy. For those patients for whom  pembrolizumab monotherapy is not as eﬀ ective as  cytotoxic chemotherapy, combinations with chemo- therapy25 or other immunotherapies26 might be needed.  To augment patient identiﬁ cation based on PD-L1  expression, which may be  limited by  tumour  heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of the immune  microenvironment,27,28 other checkpoint molecules,29  tumour inﬁ ltrating cells,30 mutational load,31 blood-based  immune  biomarkers,10  and  inﬂ ammatory  gene  signatures32,33 could be explored. Additional studies will  also be needed to determine the optimal duration of  therapy for pembrolizumab and other anti-PD-1 drugs. Our ﬁ ndings validate pembrolizumab as a new  treatment option for patients with advanced non-small  cell lung cancer who have received one or more previous 
treatment regimen and who have a tumour proportion  score of at least 1%. These data also support the use of a  dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks and validate the use of  PD-L1 selection in this population.
