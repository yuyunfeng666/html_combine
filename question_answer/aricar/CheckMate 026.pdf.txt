Abstract
BACKGROUND— Nivolumab has been associated with longer overall survival than docetaxel  among patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In an open-label  phase 3 trial, we compared first-line nivolumab with chemotherapy in patients with programmed  death ligand 1 (PD-Ll)-positive NSCLC.
METHODS— We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with untreated stage IV or recurrent  NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor-expression level of 1% or more to receive nivolumab (administered  intravenously at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight once every 2 weeks) or platinum- based chemotherapy (administered once every 3 weeks for up to six cycles). Patients receiving  chemotherapy could cross over to receive nivolumab at the time of disease progression. The  primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by means of blinded independent  central review, among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more.
RESULTS— Among the 423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, the median  progression-free survival was 4.2 months with nivolumab versus 5.9 months with chemo-therapy  (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.45;  P=0.25), and the median overall survival was 14.4 months versus 13.2 months (hazard ratio for  death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.30). A total of 128 of 212 patients (60%) in the chemotherapy  group received nivolumab as subsequent therapy. Treatment-related adverse events of any grade  occurred in 71% of the patients who received nivolumab and in 92% of those who received  chemotherapy. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 18% of the patients  who received nivolumab and in 51% of those who received chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS — Nivolumab was not associated with significantly longer progression-free  survival than chemotherapy among patients with previously untreated stage IV or recurrent  NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more. Overall survival was similar between  groups. Nivolumab had a favorable safety profile, as compared with chemotherapy, with no new or  unexpected safety signals.

FOR THE PAST TWO DECADES, PLATINUM-based combination chemotherapy has been  the standard-of-care, first-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung  cancer (NSCLC) without mutations that were sensitive to targeted therapy.1,2 However,  chemo-therapy has provided only a moderate benefit, with a limited safety profile. In phase  3 clinical trials, the median progression-free survival with platinum-based chemotherapy  was 4 to 6 months, and the median overall survival was 10 to 13 months.3– 8
In two phase 3 trials, nivolumab, a programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint- inhibitor antibody, resulted in significantly longer overall survival than docetaxel among  patients with metastatic NSCLC who had disease progression during or after platinum-based  chemo-therapy.9– 11 Benefit was seen regardless of the PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression  level but was enhanced in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC with increasing PD-L1  expression.9,10
In a multicohort phase 1 study involving previously untreated patients with NSCLC (Check- Mate 012),12 preliminary data from a cohort of 20 patients who received nivolumab  monotherapy showed durable responses and a favorable safety profile. Among the 10  patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, the objective response rate was 50%,  the rate of progression-free survival at 24 weeks was 70%, and the median progression-free  survival was 10.6 months.13 Although an increasing PD-L1 expression level was associated  with greater benefit in the expanded cohort, clinical activity was also seen in patients with a  low PD-L1 expression level or with no PD-L1 expression.12 On the basis of this preliminary  data set and the finding that approximately 12 to 15% of the patients had a PD-L1 result  showing expression between 1% and 4% across studies of nivolumab involving patients with  NSCLC (Bristol-Myers Squibb, data on file), progression-free survival among patients with  a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more was chosen as the primary end point because this  population was thought to be more likely to show a progression-free survival benefit with  nivolumab than patients with a lower (<5%) PD-L1 expression level.
Owing to the complexity of the immune system, biomarkers for response to immuno-onco- logic agents beyond PD-L1 expression levels are being explored. Early data support the  hypothesis that a high tumor-mutation burden may in crease the likelihood of benefit from  immune-therapy, because a high tumor-mutation burden may enhance tumor  immunogenicity by increasing the number of neoantigens, which are recognized by T cells  as nonself, leading to an anti-tumor immune response.14
We report the results of an international, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial (CheckMate  026) that compared the efficacy and safety of nivolumab with those of platinum-based  chemo-therapy as first-line therapy in patients with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC with a PD- L1 expression level of 5% or more (primary efficacy analysis population) and those with a  PD-L1 expression level of 1% or more (secondary efficacy analysis population).  Furthermore, we report an exploratory analysis to assess the effects of the tumor-mutation  burden on treatment outcomes.

METHODS
PATIENTS
Page 3
Eligible adult patients had histologically confirmed squamous-cell or nonsquamous stage IV  or recurrent NSCLC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status  score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher numbers indicating greater disability), and  measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  (RECIST), version 1.1,15 and had received no previous systemic anti-cancer therapy as  primary therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Patients with central nervous system  metastases were eligible if they had been adequately treated and had been asymptomatic for  at least 2 weeks before randomization. Eligible patients had to not be taking glucocorticoids  or had to be taking a stable or decreasing dose of 10 mg or less of prednisone daily (or its  equivalent). Previous palliative radiotherapy, if completed at least 2 weeks before  randomization, and previous adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemo-therapy that was completed at  least 6 months before enrollment were permitted. Patients with an autoimmune disease or  known EGFR mutations or ALK translocations that were sensitive to available targeted  therapy were excluded.
Fresh or archival tumor-biopsy specimens obtained within 6 months before enrollment were  tested for PD-L1 by a centralized laboratory with the use of the anti-PD-L1 antibody (28–8  antibody).9,10 Only patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 1% or more underwent  randomization. Written informed consent was provided by all the patients before enrollment.
TRIAL DESIGN AND TREATMENT
Patients were enrolled from March 2014 through April 2015. Eligible patients were  randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of  body weight every 2 weeks) or the investigator ’s choice of platinum doublet chemotherapy  (every 3 weeks for four to six cycles) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available  with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Chemotherapy was continued until disease  progression, the occurrence of an unacceptable level of toxic effects, or the completion of  permitted cycles. Maintenance therapy with pemetrexed was allowed in patients with  nonsquamous NSCLC who had stable disease or a response after cycle 4. Treatment with  nivolumab beyond progression was permitted if protocol-defined criteria were met,  including investigator-assessed clinical benefit, no rapid disease progression, no  unacceptable level of adverse events related to nivolumab, and a stable performance status,  and if there was no interference with imminent intervention to prevent serious complications  of disease progression. Concomitant systemic glucocorticoid treatment (courses lasting <3  weeks) was allowed for nonautoimmune conditions, including but not limited to treatment- related adverse events with a potential immune-logic cause.
Randomization was stratified according to PD-L1 expression level (<5% vs. >5%) and  tumor histologic findings (squamous vs. nonsquamous). Patients in the chemotherapy group  who had disease progression according to RECIST, as assessed by the investigator and  confirmed by an independent radiologist, could cross over to receive nivolumab, provided  that eligibility criteria were met. For patients in the chemotherapy group, dose delays and

two or fewer dose reductions because of toxic effects were allowed. For patients in the  nivolumab group, dose delays because of toxic effects were allowed, but dose reductions  were not allowed.
END POINTS AND ASSESSMENTS
The primary end point was progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded independent  central review, among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more. Secondary end  points included progression-free survival, as assessed by means of blinded independent  central review, among all the patients who had undergone randomization (of whom all had a  PD-L1 expression level of >1%), overall survival among patients with a PD-L1 expression  level of 5% or more and among all the patients who had undergone randomization, and the  independently assessed response rate among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5%  or more.
Tumor response was assessed every 6 weeks until week 48 and every 12 weeks thereafter.  Safety assessments included the recording of adverse events, which were graded according  to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version  4.0. The investigators determined whether an adverse event was related to a trial drug.
EXPLORATORY BIOMARKER ANALYSIS OF TUMOR-MUTATION BURDEN
The tumor-mutation burden, which was defined as the total number of somatic missense  mutations present in a baseline tumor sample, was determined in patients with tumor and  blood samples sufficient for whole-exome sequencing. For efficacy analyses, patients were  grouped in thirds according to tumor-mutation burden. The boundaries for these three  groups were a tumor-mutation burden of 0 to less than 100 mutations (low burden), 100 to  242 mutations (medium burden), and 243 or more mutations (high burden). All the testing  and analyses of tumor-mutation burden were exploratory and not prespecified, including the  evaluation according to distribution into the three groups. The testing was conducted in a  research laboratory, and the methodologic approach that we used has not been approved by  the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments program as a clinical diagnostic test.  Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
TRIAL OVERSIGHT
The trial was designed and data were analyzed jointly by the sponsor (Bristol-Myers Squibb)  and a steering committee, with the participation of individual authors. All the investigators  collected data. The trial protocol, available at NEJM.org, was approved by the institutional  review board or independent ethics committee at each center. The trial was conducted in  accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines on Good  Clinical Practice and the Declara tion of Helsinki. An independent data and safety  monitoring committee provided oversight of safety and efficacy. This report is based on the  final data analysis (database locked on August 2, 2016).
All the authors attest that the trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol and vouch  for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses. All the authors signed a  confidentiality agreement with the sponsor. Medical writing support, including writing of the

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The sample-size estimation for the primary efficacy analysis population (patients with a PD- L1 expression level of >5%) was based on an expected median progression-free survival of 7  months in the chemotherapy group and an overall hazard ratio for disease progression or  death of 0.71 favoring nivolumab. We estimated that a sample of approximately 415 patients  would provide the trial with 80% power to detect a difference in treatment effect on the  primary end point with the use of a log-rank test with a two-sided significance level of 5%  after a minimum follow-up of approximately 18 months in patients with no disease  progression or death.
The between-group comparisons of progression-free survival and overall survival were  performed by means of two-sided log-rank tests stratified according to PD-L1 expression  level (<5% vs. >5%, for end points in all the patients who had undergone randomization)  and tumor histologic findings. We used a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model that  included the randomized treatment group as a single covariate to estimate hazard ratios and  their associated 95% confidence intervals. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate  survival curves. Response rates were compared between treatment groups with the use of a  two-sided, stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. The Clopper-Pearson method was used  to estimate response rates and their exact 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS
PATIENTS AND TREATMENT
Of 1325 patients enrolled in the trial, 541 (41%) underwent randomization, with 271  assigned to receive nivolumab and 270 assigned to receive chemotherapy. A total of 784  patients (59%) did not undergo randomization because their PD-L1 samples could not be  evaluated (6% of patients), because the PD-L1 expression level was less than 1% (23%), or  because they did not meet other trial criteria (30%). During screening, 746 of 1047 patients  (71%) who had PD-L1 results that could be evaluated had a PD-L1 expression of 1% or  more. Overall, 530 patients (98% of all the patients who had undergone randomization)  received treatment (Fig. S1A and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The primary efficacy analysis population (423 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of  >5%) constituted 78% of all the patients who had undergone randomization. The median  time from diagnosis to randomization of all the patients was 1.9 months (range, 0.3 to 214.9)  in the nivolumab group and 2.0 months (range, 0.5 to 107.3) in the chemotherapy group,  with 76% and 72% of patients, respectively, being assigned to the corresponding treatment  groups within 3 months after diagnosis. Overall, 39% of the patients had received  radiotherapy previously.
The baseline characteristics of all the patients who underwent randomization were similar to  those of the patients who were included in the primary efficacy analysis (Table 1, and Tables  S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among all the patients, the baseline

characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment groups. However, in the  nivolumab group, the percentage of women was lower than that in the chemo-therapy group  (32% vs. 45%), as was the percentage of patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 50% or  more (32% vs. 47%); the percentage of patients with liver metastases was slightly higher in  the nivolumab group (20% vs. 13%). In addition, patients in the nivolumab group had a  greater tumor burden (on the basis of the median sum of target-lesion diameters) than those  in the chemotherapy group (Table 1).
The minimum follow-up for overall survival was 13.7 months, and the median follow-up  was 13.5 months (the minimum follow-up was computed as the time from randomization of  the last patient to the database lock, and the median follow-up was computed for all the  patients from randomization to the last known vital-status date). The median duration of  therapy was 3.7 months (range, 0.0 to 26.9+ [the plus sign indicates an ongoing status at the  time of the database lock]) in the nivolumab group and 3.4 months (range, 0.0 to 20.9+) in  the chemo-therapy group. Details regarding the chemotherapy regimens are provided in  Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. A total of 38% of treated patients received  maintenance pemetrexed. A total of 77 of 267 patients (29%) who were treated with  nivolumab received nivolumab beyond investigator-assessed progression according to  RECIST. A total of 26 patients received more than six doses of nivolumab after progression.
Among the 211 patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more in the nivolumab  group, 92 (44%) received subsequent systemic cancer therapy, and 39 (18%) continued  receiving nivolumab at the time of the database lock. Among the corresponding 212 patients  in the chemotherapy group, 136 (64%) received subsequent systemic therapy, including 128  (60%) who received nivolumab — 58% as crossover treatment within the trial and 3% in  clinical practice after the trial; 1 patient received the drug both within the trial and after the  trial (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Efficacy Analysis Population and All Patients—
In the primary efficacy  analysis population (patients with a PD-L1 expression level of >5%), there was no  significant difference in progression-free survival between treatment groups (Fig. 1A). The  median progression-free survival was 4.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 5.6)  in the nivolumab group and 5.9 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 6.9) in the chemotherapy group  (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.45; P = 0.25). The  median overall survival in the primary efficacy analysis population was 14.4 months (95%  CI, 11.7 to 17.4) in the nivolumab group and 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.7 to 17.1) in the  chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.30) (Fig. 1B). Similar  results regarding progression-free survival and overall survival were found in the analyses  that included all the patients who had undergone randomization (Figs. S2 and S3 in the  Supplementary Appendix).
The response rate among patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more was 26% in  the nivolumab group and 33% in the chemotherapy group (Table 2). The nivolumab group  had a higher percentage of patients than the chemo-therapy group with a best response of  progressive disease (27% vs. 10%). The median time to response was similar in the

nivolumab group and the chemotherapy group (2.8 months and 2.6 months, respectively),  whereas the median duration of response was more than twice as long with nivolumab as  with chemotherapy (12.1 vs. 5.7 months) (Table 2).
Selected Subgroups— Across most planned subgroups (which included all the patients  who had undergone randomization), the results of the analyses of progression-free survival  and overall survival were consistent with the overall trial results (Fig. 2A and 2B). The only  prespecified subgroup was patients defined according to histologic findings (a stratification  factor); patients with histologic results showing squamous-cell NSCLC had slightly longer  progression-free survival and overall survival with nivolumab than with chemotherapy,  although the results were not significant (Fig. 2A and 2B).
In the exploratory subgroup analysis involving patients with a PD-L1 expression level of  50% or more, the hazard ratio for disease progression or death was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.77 to  1.49), and the hazard ratio for death was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.29). In this subgroup, the  response rate was 34% (95% CI, 24 to 45) in the nivolumab group and 39% (95% CI, 30 to  48) in the chemotherapy group. Because patients were not stratified according to whether  they had a PD-L1 expression level of 50% or more, the nivolumab group had fewer patients  than the chemotherapy group (88 vs. 126), and the imbalance in sex that was noted in the  overall population (32% of the patients in the nivolumab group vs. 45% in the chemotherapy  group were women) was even more pronounced in this subgroup (25% of the patients in the  nivolumab subgroup vs. 44% in the chemotherapy subgroup were women). The  corresponding findings for the subgroups of the primary efficacy analysis population are  provided in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
An exploratory analysis was conducted in 312 patients (58% of the patients who had  undergone randomization) to assess the effect of the tumor-mutation burden on outcomes  (Fig. 2C and 2D). The percentage of patients with a high tumor-mutation burden was  imbalanced between the treatment groups (30% in the nivolumab group vs. 39% in the  chemotherapy group). The characteristics at baseline and the results regarding progression- free survival and overall sur vival were generally consistent with those in the total  population. Details are provided in Tables S6, S7, and S8 and in Figures S5 through S14 in  the Supplementary Appendix.
Among the patients with a high tumor-mutation burden, the response rate was higher in the  nivolumab group than in the chemotherapy group (47% vs. 28%), and progression-free  survival was longer (median, 9.7 vs. 5.8 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or  death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.38 to 1.00) (Fig. 2C). Overall survival was similar between groups  regardless of the tumor-mutation burden. However, 68% of the patients with a high tumor- mutation burden in the chemotherapy group received subsequent nivolumab because of  treatment crossover, access to nivolumab after the trial, or both. There was no significant  association between tumor-mutation burden and PD-L1 expression level (Pearson’s  correlation coefficient = 0.059). However, in the nivolumab group, patients with both a high  tumor-mutation burden and a PD-L1 expression level of 50% or more had a higher response  rate (75%) than those with only one of these factors (32% among patients with a high tumor- mutation burden only and 34% among those with a PD-L1 expression level of >50% only)

SAFETY
Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in 71% of the patients treated with  nivolumab and in 92% of those treated with chemotherapy. The percentage of patients with  treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was lower with nivolumab than with  chemotherapy (18% vs. 51%) (Table 3, and Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). The  rates of treatment-related serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. Treatment- related adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug were 10% with  nivolumab and 13% with chemo-therapy (Table 3, and Tables S10, S11, and S12 in the  Supplementary Appendix). The most common selected adverse events (those with a  potential immunologic cause) that were adjudicated as being related to treatment were skin- related events in the nivolumab group and gastrointestinal events in the chemotherapy group  (Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Five deaths were attributed to study treatment. There were two deaths in the nivolumab  group (one each from multiorgan failure and pneumonitis) and three in the chemotherapy  group (one from sepsis and two from febrile neutropenia).
DISCUSSION
In the primary efficacy population in this trial involving patients with stage IV or recurrent  NSCLC and a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more, patients who received first-line mono- therapy with nivolumab did not have longer progression-free survival than those who  received chemotherapy. Overall survival was similar in the two treatment groups, comparing  favorably with historical controls of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.3– 8 Given that  nivolumab therapy prolongs survival among previously treated patients with advanced  NSCLC,9,10 the high frequency of subsequent nivolumab treatment may have contributed to  the favorable overall survival in the chemotherapy group. In addition, imbalances in the  characteristics of the patients at baseline may have favored the chemotherapy group,  including disease characteristics that are associated with a better prognosis (i.e., slightly  fewer liver metastases, smaller tumor burden, and a higher proportion of women). Two  factors that appear in retrospect to have had an influence on the response to nivolumab (i.e.,  a PD-L1 expression level of >50% and a high tumor-mutation burden) also disfavored the  nivolumab group, which had lower proportions of such patients than did the chemotherapy  group.3,4,16
Two additional observations worth noting are the high percentage of patients in this trial  who had received radiotherapy previously (39%) and the median time from diagnosis to  randomization of approximately 2 months. Both these results may be attributed in part to the  patients with recurrent disease who enrolled in this trial or to protocol criteria that allowed  previous palliative radiotherapy up to 2 weeks before randomization, with further language  encouraging patients with symptomatic tumor lesions to receive this therapy before  randomization. This approach may have selected for a population of patients who had a  poorer prognosis because of a high tumor burden and advanced disease; however, the results

in the chemotherapy group with regard to response rate and progression-free survival do not  support this interpretation.
The KEYN0TE-024 trial17 established a role for the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab  versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with NSCLC with a PD-L1  expression level of 50% or more as determined by means of the Dako 22C3 PD-L1 test in a  prospectively designed trial. The median progression-free survival was 10.3 months in the  pembrolizumab group and 6.0 months in the chemotherapy group. The response rate was  45% in the pembrolizumab group and 28% in the chemotherapy group.
Analyses comparing treatment efficacy in patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 50% or  more were not prespecified in CheckMate 026, and the two groups had an imbalance in the  number of patients (88 vs. 126), thereby limiting the conclusions that can be drawn in this  subgroup. By contrast, the KEYN0TE-024 trial prospectively assessed the activity of  pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in patients who had advanced NSCLC with a PD-L1  expression level of at least 50% and who had not received chemo-therapy previously.17  Other differences between the trials have been outlined in a recent review article.18  Examples include the different assays to assess PD-L1 tumor expression, the criteria related  to previous radiotherapy and glucocorticoid use during the trials, and imbalances between  groups in the characteristics of the patients (e.g., sex in CheckMate 026 and the lower  percentage of patients who had never smoked in the immunotherapy group in  KEYNOTE-024 [3%] than in Check-Mate 026 [11%]).17,18 Although the precise reasons for  the divergent outcomes of the KEYNOTE-024 trial and the CheckMate 026 trial remain  unclear and cannot be attributed to a single factor, the differences outlined above may be  contributing factors.
In an exploratory, hypothesis-generating analysis, among patients with a high tumor- mutation burden, nivolumab was associated with a higher response rate than chemotherapy  (47% vs. 28%) and with a longer median progression-free survival (9.7 vs. 5.8 months). No  between-group difference was noted with regard to overall survival in the subgroup of  patients with a high tumor-mutation burden, which may be explained in part by the high rate  of subsequent nivolumab use (68% of patients) in the chemotherapy group. Nevertheless, the  subgroup of patients with a high tumor-mutation burden in the nivolumab group had notable  overall survival (median, >18 months; overall survival rate at 1 year, 64%). The level of  tumor-mutation burden and the level of tumor PD-L1 expression did not appear to be  associated; however, information about the tumor-mutation burden in patients with a PD-L1  expression level of less than 1% was not available, because such patients were not enrolled  in this trial. These data are consistent with previous reports suggesting no association  between tumor-mutation burden and PD-L1 expression in patients treated with  pembrolizumab and only a weak association between tumor-mutation burden and PD-L1  expression in those treated with atezolizumab.19,20 Patients with both a high tumor-mutation  burden and a PD-L1 expression level of 50% or more may have a greater likelihood of re  sponse to nivolumab than those with only one or neither of these factors. Overall, the current  findings are consistent with the hypothesis that immunotherapy may have enhanced activity  in patients with a high tumor-mutation burden.14 However, because this was an exploratory

analysis that was not prespecified, the data are hypothesis-generating and require further  prospective validation.
In conclusion, nivolumab monotherapy did not result in longer progression-free survival  than platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for stage IV or recurrent NSCLC  in a broad population of patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or more. Overall  survival with single-agent nivolumab was similar to overall survival with platinum doublet  chemotherapy. Nivolumab had a favorable safety profile as compared with chemotherapy,  and no new safety signals were observed.

†
Objective response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, by independent central review. The  95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method. The analysis was stratified according to tumor histologic findings. The strata- adjusted odds ratio was calculated with the use of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method.
‡
The analysis was performed with data from all the patients who had a response (55 patients in the nivolumab group and 71 in the chemotherapy  group).
§ The time to response was defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented complete or partial response.
¶ Results were calculated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The duration of response was defined as the time between the date of the first  response and the date of the first documented event of progression, death, or last tumor assessment that was evaluated before subsequent therapy  (data-censoring date). The plus sign indicates that the response was ongoing at the time of data analysis; ongoing responses are censored at the date  of the most recent scan obtained before the data analysis.
