Abstract
Background— Options for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  whose disease progresses after first-line chemotherapy are limited. This randomized, open-label,  international phase 3 study evaluated efficacy and safety of nivolumab versus docetaxel in this  patient population after failure of platinum doublet chemotherapy.
Methods— Patients were randomized to nivolumab 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks or  docetaxel 75 mg per square meter every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival.
Results— Nivolumab improved overall survival versus docetaxel. Median overall survival was  12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.0) for nivolumab (n=292) and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.7)  for docetaxel (n=290) (hazard ratio, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; P=0.002). One-year overall  survival rates were 51% (95% CI, 45 to 56) for nivolumab and 39% (95% CI, 33 to 45) for  docetaxel. Updated efficacy results with additional follow up are available for overall survival  only: 18-month overall survival rates were 39% (95% CI, 34 to 45) for nivolumab and 23% (95%  CI, 19 to 28) for docetaxel. Response rates were 19% for nivolumab and 12% for docetaxel  (P=0.02). Although progression-free survival did not favor nivolumab (2.3 months for nivolumab  versus 4.2 months for docetaxel), 1-year progression-free survival was higher for nivolumab (19%)  than docetaxel (8%). Nivolumab further improved efficacy across all endpoints at predefined ≥1%,  ≥5%, and ≥10% programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor membrane expression levels. Grade  3–5 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 10% of nivolumab and 54% of docetaxel- treated patients.
Conclusions— Compared to docetaxel, nivolumab demonstrated superior overall survival, with  PD-L1 expression conferring enhanced efficacy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC  after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. The safety profile of nivolumab was favorable  versus docetaxel.
Introduction
Effective options for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  whose disease progresses after first-line chemotherapy are limited. Docetaxel was approved  as second-line treatment for advanced NSCLC based on improvement in survival versus best  supportive care.1– 3 More tolerable newer agents, such as pemetrexed and erlotinib, were  either shown to be non-inferior or have failed to show superiority in overall survival  compared to docetaxel in this setting.4,5

The programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor expressed on activated T cells is engaged by  tumor-expressed ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 to downregulate T-cell activation and promote  tumor immune escape.6 Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor  antibody, disrupts PD-1-mediated signaling and may restore antitumor immunity.7– 9 In  phase 1 studies, nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated durable anti-tumor activity and  encouraging survival in all NSCLC subtypes.7,9,10 In heavily pretreated patients with  advanced non-squamous NSCLC, nivolumab demonstrated a response rate of 17.6%, 1-, 2-,  and 3-year overall survival rates of 42%, 23%, and 16%, respectively, and a 1-year  progression-free survival rate of 18%.10 Nivolumab is approved in the United States for  treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC and progression on or after  platinum-based chemotherapy11 and in the European Union for locally advanced or  metastatic squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy.12 We report results of a phase 3  study (CheckMate 057; NCT01673867) comparing nivolumab to docetaxel in previously  treated advanced non-squamous NSCLC.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients had documented stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC  following radiation therapy or surgical resection, and disease recurrence or progression  during or after one prior platinum-based regimen. An additional line of tyrosine kinase  inhibitor therapy in patients with known EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and  continuation or switch maintenance therapy with pemetrexed, bevacizumab or erlotinib was  allowed. Patients 18 years of age or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 (a 5-point scale in which higher numbers indicate  greater tumor-related disability), adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function, and  treated stable central nervous system (CNS) metastases were eligible. Pretreatment tumor  tissue for biomarker analyses was required but not used for patient selection. Exclusion  criteria included autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, systemic  immunosuppression, prior treatment with immune-stimulatory antitumor agents including  checkpoint-targeted agents, or docetaxel. Complete eligibility details are provided in the  study protocol available at NEJM.org.
Study design and treatments
From November, 2012 to December, 2013, 792 patients were enrolled and 582 randomized  to either nivolumab 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks (n = 292), or docetaxel 75 mg per  square meter every 3 weeks (n = 290), both intravenously (Fig. S1A). Patients were treated  until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity or other reasons (Fig. S1B).
Randomization was stratified by prior maintenance treatment and line of therapy (second- vs  third-line). Nivolumab patients could continue treatment beyond initial progression if the  investigator assessed that the patient was having clinical benefit and tolerating study drug.  Criteria for treatment delay or discontinuation for treatment-related adverse events, and  docetaxel dose reductions for toxicities, per product label, were defined. Nivolumab dose  reductions were not permitted.

Endpoints and assessments
Page 4
The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was assessed while on treatment, and  every 3 months after treatment discontinuation. All randomized patients were followed for  survival, unless they had withdrawn consent from survival follow up. Survival information  was obtained through a search of publicly available sources for patients who withdrew  consent for or were lost to follow up. Secondary efficacy endpoints included investigator- assessed confirmed objective response rate and progression-free survival, efficacy by tumor  PD-L1 expression, and patient-reported outcomes. All randomized patients were followed  for disease progression, except for those who had withdrawn consent from the study or who  were lost to follow up. Tumor response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria In  Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)13 at week 9 and every 6 weeks thereafter until  disease progression. Safety was assessed by evaluating the incidence of adverse events and  laboratory parameters, graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Select adverse events (those with potential  immunologic etiologies) were grouped according to predefined categories. Analyses of  patient-reported outcome measures are ongoing.
PD-L1 biomarker analysis
Tumor PD-L1 protein expression was retrospectively assessed in prospectively collected,  pretreatment (archival or recent) tumor biopsies using a validated, automated  immunohistochemical assay (Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA) using a rabbit anti- human PD-L1 antibody (clone 28–8; Epitomics Inc, Burlingame, CA). Predefined  expression levels were defined by tumor cell membrane staining (any intensity) in a section  containing at least 100 evaluable tumor cells.
Study oversight
The study was designed by the authors in collaboration with the sponsor, which worked  jointly with investigators to collect and analyze data. The study protocol was approved by an  Institutional Review Board or ethics committee at each participating center, and conducted  in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on  Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice; the protocol and statistical analysis  plan are available with the full text of the manuscript at www.nejm.org. Written informed  consent was collected from all patients before enrollment.
An independent data monitoring committee provided oversight of safety and efficacy. On  April 16, 2015, the committee declared superiority in overall survival for nivolumab versus  docetaxel. We report the interim analysis results here, including overall survival, objective  response rate, progression free survival and safety, based on a March 18, 2015 database lock.  Updated efficacy results with additional follow up are reported for overall survival only,  based on a July 2, 2015 database lock.
All authors attest that the study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and vouch  for data accuracy. The first draft of this manuscript was written by first and last authors; all  authors contributed to subsequent drafts, agreed to submit the manuscript for publication,

Statistical analyses
Overall survival and progression-free survival were analyzed using a two-sided log-rank test  stratified by prior maintenance treatment and line of therapy. Hazard ratios and confidence  intervals (CIs) were estimated using a stratified, Cox proportional hazards model. Survival  curves and rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Objective response rates  were compared using a stratified, two-sided Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test. Non- conventional benefit (i.e., a reduction in the size or number [or both] of target lesions with  simultaneous appearance of new lesions or initial progression followed by either tumor  reduction or no further progression for at least two tumor assessments) in patients treated  beyond initial progression was not included for response-based analyses (objective response  rate or progression-free survival). Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed on overall  survival, objective response rate and progression-free survival to assess the consistency of  treatment effects among patient subpopulations. All prespecified subgroup analyses of  survival are reported in the supplementary appendix using unstratified hazard ratios and 95%  CIs; hazard ratios were not computed for subgroups with fewer than 10 patients per  treatment group. Additional prespecified analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic  and predictive roles of PD-L1 expression, with an interaction P value of <0.2 considered a  signal of predictive association.
Demographic and efficacy analyses included all randomized patients. Safety analyses  included all treated patients (received at least one dose of study drug). At the time of interim  analysis, 413 patients had expired (93% of the 442 deaths required for the final analysis).  The boundary for declaring superiority for overall survival at the interim analysis was  P<0.0408, based on the O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. If superiority for overall  survival was demonstrated, then response rate and progression-free survival were tested  hierarchically at the 5% alpha level. The formal primary endpoint testing was based on the  interim analysis. For full description of the additional follow-up data, an updated p-value is  provided based on July 2, 2015 database lock.
Results
Patients and treatment
Of randomized patients, 287 were treated with nivolumab and 268 were treated with  docetaxel. Median age was 62 years. Most patients were ECOG performance status 1, stage  IV, and current/former smokers (Table 1 and S1). Baseline characteristics were balanced  between treatment groups, with slight imbalances for male sex and age 65 or younger.
A median of 6 doses (range, 1–52) of nivolumab and 4 doses (range, 1–23) of docetaxel  were administered. In the nivolumab and docetaxel groups, respectively, 83% and 66% of  patients received at least 90% of the planned dose intensity. At least one dose delay occurred  in 39% of nivolumab and 37% of docetaxel patients. Most nivolumab (53%, 117/219 cycles)  and docetaxel (67%, 99/147 cycles) delays lasted ≤7 days; 26% of patients required a

docetaxel dose reduction. Forty-five percent of nivolumab and 46% of docetaxel delays were  due to adverse events.
At the time of interim analysis, 15% of nivolumab and no docetaxel patients were continuing  treatment (Table S2). Subsequent systemic therapy was received by 42% of nivolumab and  50% of docetaxel patients. Of nivolumab patients, 23% received subsequent docetaxel; 2%  of docetaxel patients received subsequent immunotherapy (Table S3).
Nivolumab significantly improved overall survival versus docetaxel (Fig. 1A). At the time of  interim analysis (minimum follow-up for overall survival, 13.2 months), median overall  survival was 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.0) for nivolumab and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1  to 10.7) for docetaxel, a 27% reduction in risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to  0.89; P=0.002). One-year overall survival rates were 51% (95% CI, 45 to 56) and 39% (95%  CI, 33 to 45) for nivolumab and docetaxel, respectively. Overall survival hazard ratios  favored nivolumab across most predefined patient subgroups, except for third-line therapy (n  = 66), rest of world region (n = 98), CNS metastases (n = 68), never smokers (n = 118) and  EGFR mutation-positive status (n = 82) (Fig. 1B and S2). With additional follow-up  (minimum, 17.2 months), median overall survival was 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.1) for  nivolumab and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.7) for docetaxel, a 28% reduction in risk of  death (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.88; P=0.0009) (Fig. S3). Eighteen-month overall  survival rates were 39% (95% CI, 34 to 45) and 23% (95% CI, 19 to 28) for nivolumab and  docetaxel, respectively.
Confirmed objective response rate was significantly higher for nivolumab versus docetaxel  (Table 2 and Fig. S4); 19% (95% CI, 15 to 24) versus 12% (95% CI, 9 to 17) (P=0.02).  Median time to response was 2.1 months (range, 1.2–8.6) for nivolumab and 2.6 months  (range, 1.4–6.3) for docetaxel (Table 2 and Fig. 1C). Median duration of response was 17.2  months (range, 1.8–22.6+) for nivolumab and 5.6 months (range, 1.2+ to 15.2+) for  docetaxel.
Median progression-free survival and 1-year progression-free survival rates were 2.3 months  (95% CI, 2.2 to 3.3) and 19% (95% CI, 14 to 23), respectively, for nivolumab and 4.2  months (95% CI, 3.5 to 4.9) and 8% (95% CI, 5 to 12), respectively, for docetaxel (Fig. 1D).  The hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.1; P=0.39) (Fig.  1D). Progression-free survival hazard ratios numerically favored nivolumab across most  predefined patient subgroups, except for third-line therapy, rest of world region, never  smokers, KRAS mutation not detected (n = 123) and EGFR mutation-positive status (Fig.  S5).
In total, 71 (25%) nivolumab patients continued treatment beyond initial progression, 16  (23%) of whom demonstrated a non-conventional pattern of benefit. Characteristics of  patients treated beyond progression, including change in tumor burden over time, are  provided (Fig. S6 and Table S4).

Safety
Of randomized patients, 78% (455/582) had quantifiable PD-L1 expression. Rates of PD-L1  expression were balanced between groups (Table S5). At the time of interim analysis, test  for interaction suggested a strong predictive association between PD-L1 and clinical  outcome at all expression levels for all efficacy endpoints (Table S6). Nivolumab  demonstrated improved overall survival, progression-free survival (Fig. S7) and objective  response rates (Table S5) at prespecified ≥1%, ≥5% and ≥10% PD-L1 expression levels.  Progression-free survival across all prespecified PD-L1 subgroups based on the interim  analysis database lock is provided in Fig. S8A. Overall survival by PD-L1 expression level  based on the July 2015 database lock is shown in Fig. S8B; the difference in overall survival  between nivolumab and docetaxel among patients whose tumors express PD-L1 was still  evident with additional follow-up. Median duration of response was longer with nivolumab  versus docetaxel across all PD-L1 expression levels (Table S5).
The frequencies of all-causality, any-grade adverse events were similar between arms, but  fewer grade 3– 4 adverse events were reported with nivolumab than docetaxel (Table S7).  Treatment-related adverse events were low in severity with nivolumab and less frequent  (any-grade: 69%; grade 3–4: 10%) than with docetaxel (any-grade: 88%; grade 3–4: 54%)  (Table 3 and S8). The most frequently reported any-grade treatment-related adverse events  for nivolumab were fatigue (16%), nausea (12%), decreased appetite (10%), and asthenia  (10%). The most frequently reported any-grade treatment-related adverse events for  docetaxel were neutropenia (31%), fatigue (29%), nausea (26%), and alopecia (25%).  Treatment-related serious adverse events were less frequent with nivolumab (any-grade: 7%;  grade 3–4: 5%) than docetaxel (any-grade: 20%; grade 3–4: 18%) (Table S9).
The most frequently-reported (≥2.5% of patients) any-grade treatment-related select adverse  events (nivolumab versus docetaxel) were rash (9% versus 3%), pruritus (8% versus 1%),  erythema (1% versus 4%), diarrhea (8% versus 23%), hypothyroidism (7% versus 0%),  increased alanine aminotransferase (3% versus 1%), increased aspartate aminotransferase  (3% versus 1%), infusion related reaction (3% versus 3%), and pneumonitis (3% versus  <1%) (Table S10). Across categories, median times to onset of any-grade treatment-related  select adverse events for nivolumab ranged from 0.9 to 31.1 weeks (Table S11). Of those  who experienced treatment-related select adverse events across categories (Table S11), 11%  to 70% were treated with immune-modulating agents (generally glucocorticoids), per  protocol guidelines. Across categories, 44% to 100% of treatment-related select adverse  events resolved, with median times to resolution ranging from 0.1 to 12.1 weeks (Table  S11). Median time to resolution of treatment-related select endocrinopathies was not  reached, as a proportion of these events are not expected to resolve. The frequencies of  treatment-related adverse events, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to  discontinuation were similar between patients with ≥1% PD-L1and <1% PD-L1 expression  (Table S12).
Discontinuation due to treatment–related adverse events was less frequent with nivolumab  (5%) than docetaxel (15%) (Tables S13 and S14). The most common treatment-related  adverse event leading to discontinuation was pneumonitis (1%) for nivolumab, and fatigue

(3%) for docetaxel. One death each in the nivolumab (encephalitis, reported before but  causality changed after the database lock) and docetaxel (febrile neutropenia) groups were  assessed as treatment-related.
Discussion
Despite the increased number of treatment options for NSCLC, minimal improvement in  overall survival has been noted, except in patients with EGFR mutations or ALK  translocations. Docetaxel is regarded as the standard of care for previously treated advanced  NSCLC and is an appropriate comparator for this trial. In our phase 3 study in advanced  non-squamous NSCLC, nivolumab was associated with a significant survival benefit versus  docetaxel (27% reduction in risk of death at 13.2 months minimum follow up) that persisted  with extended follow up (28% reduction in risk of death at 17.2 months minimum follow  up).
The observed overall survival curve for nivolumab in this population is consistent with a  prior nivolumab study.10 Furthermore, a delay in the separation of nivolumab and docetaxel  overall survival curves is consistent with results of other immune system-modifying agents  in advanced melanoma.14
In a recently published phase 3 study, docetaxel with ramucirumab, a vascular endothelial  growth factor 2 inhibitor, showed a 1.4 month improvement in survival over docetaxel alone  (11.1 versus 9.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.83) in patients with non-squamous NSCLC.15 In our  study, the overall survival improvement is 2.8 months (12.2 versus 9.4 months; hazard ratio,  0.73) with nivolumab monotherapy which persisted with extended follow-up. A percentage  of patients who were randomized to receive docetaxel were never treated (8%, 22/290);  however, those patients were followed for overall survival, and the impact on the overall  results is minimal. Benefit of nivolumab was further reflected by a significantly higher  objective response rate (19% versus 12%) and markedly better response durability (17.2  versus 5.6 months) as compared to other treatment options for patients in this setting.4,16,17
Nivolumab showed significant improvement in overall survival and response rate but not in  progression-free survival. A crossing of progression-free survival curves was noted with a  delay in benefit of nivolumab supported by a 1-year progression-free survival rate of 19%  versus 8% for docetaxel, which may be typical for immunotherapy. The numerically lower  median progression-free survival observed for nivolumab is not due to underperformance, as  median progression-free survival reported here is consistent with another nivolumab study,10  but may be explained in part by the higher median progression-free survival of docetaxel in  this study (4.2 months) versus previously reported data in non-squamous NSCLC (2.8 to 3.7  months).15,18 It is also possible that the observed progression-free survival results may be  driven by patient subgroups, as suggested by the subgroup analyses for smoking status and  EGFR mutation. Outcomes observed for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors may  be attributed to better outcomes on the docetaxel arm. However, interpretation of these  results is limited by the wide CIs for calculated hazard ratios in a small subset of patients,  and possibly by incomplete collection of mutation data. A biological rationale for different  outcomes in never smokers and EGFR mutation-positive patients may be related to low

levels of mutational heterogeneity, as preliminary data suggest that sensitivity to immune- checkpoint inhibitors may be higher in tumors bearing high levels of somatic mutations.19,20  However, this study is not designed to test this hypothesis, and additional studies are  warranted to address this question.
The current study, which included patients regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level and  comparison to a control arm, is the first to demonstrate a predictive association between PD- L1 expression and benefit from anti-PD-1 treatment. Analyzed tumor samples included  archived tissue, suggesting applicability in a real world setting where fresh tissue may not be  available or repeat biopsy not feasible. For each of the predefined expression levels  examined, the descriptive treatment-biomarker interaction P value met the predefined  threshold, suggesting a predictive association with clinical benefit. Although benefit of  nivolumab was observed in the overall population, the magnitude of benefit across all  efficacy endpoints was greater among those whose tumors express PD-L1 (Figs. S7 and S8  and Table S5). Consistent with a recently reported phase 1 study of pembrolizumab in  NSCLC,21 there was a trend toward greater response rate as PD-L1 expression level  increased; however, a meaningful separation of the overall survival curves was observed  across all predefined expression levels. Among patients whose tumors express PD-L1 ( ≥1%,  ≥5% and ≥10% expression levels), nivolumab nearly doubled median overall survival versus  docetaxel. No meaningful differences in overall survival were noted between nivolumab and  docetaxel among patients whose tumors have no PD-L1 expression. These data are in  contrast to results with squamous NSCLC, where PD-L1 expression did not impact  nivolumab clinical activity.22,23 This may imply inherent differences in the immune milieu  of squamous and non-squamous histologies, suggesting two distinct diseases.
Although there was no difference in overall survival between nivolumab and docetaxel  among patients whose tumors have no PD-L1 expression, the improved safety profile and  durability of responses to nivolumab suggests it might be a reasonable option for patients  regardless of PD-L1 expression. Additional work is warranted to characterize sub- populations whose disease progresses early and who may benefit from combination  therapies.
The safety profile of nivolumab observed in this study (Table 3) is consistent with prior  studies and was favorable versus docetaxel, with most patients experiencing adverse events  of low severity. Only a small percentage of nivolumab patients reported immune-related  adverse events, including pneumonitis, which were managed using protocol guidelines.
In summary, nivolumab led to a statistically superior survival benefit versus docetaxel in  unselected patients with advanced previously treated non-squamous NSCLC.
