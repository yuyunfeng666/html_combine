Summary
Background First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy improves overall and progression-free survival in patients with  untreated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score  (TPS) of 50% or greater. We investigated overall survival after treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in  patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater.
Methods This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients  were adults (≥18 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without a  sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)  performance status score of 0 or 1, life expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. Randomisation  was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and  stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology  (squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (≥50% vs 1–49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in  blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator’s  choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with  a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0·0122, p=0·0120,  and p=0·0124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the previous findings were  significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894.
Findings From Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57–69])  with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included  in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of  20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12·8 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the  pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (≥50% hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI  0·56–0·85, p=0·0003; ≥20% 0·77, 0·64–0·92, p=0·0020, and ≥1% 0·81, 0·71–0·93, p=0·0018). The median surival  values by TPS population were 20·0 months (95% CI 15·4–24·9) for pembrolizumab versus 12·2 months (10·4–14·2)  for chemotherapy, 17·7 months (15·3–22·1) versus 13·0 months (11·6–15·3), and 16·7 months (13·9–19·7) versus  12·1 months (11·3–13·3), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of  636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death  in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, respectively.
Interpretation The benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line  therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK  alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS.

Introduction
The ultimate objective of treating advanced non-small-cell  lung cancer is to improve overall survival and quality of  life. Before the availability of molecularly targeted therapy,  advanced non-small-cell lung cancer was treated with  chemotherapy, which is associated with a median survival 
of approximately 12 months1 and has a poor adverse event  profile. Targeted therapies have become standard first-line  therapy for patients with driver oncogenes. Median  survival in phase 3 trials ranged from 18·6 months to  30·5 months for tyrosine-kinase inhibitors targeting  EGFR mutations2–4 and extends beyond 4 years for those

Research in context
Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on June 15, 2018, with the term “PD-1 OR  PD-L1 OR MK-3475 OR pembrolizumab OR Keytruda OR  BMS-936558 OR nivolumab OR Opdivo OR MPDL3280A OR  atezolizumab OR Tecentriq OR MEDI4736 OR durvalumab OR  Imfinzi OR MSB0010718C OR avelumab OR Bavencio AND  metastatic AND first line OR previously untreated AND non-small  cell lung cancer OR NSCLC.” We also used this term to search the  abstracts from the 2017 and 2018 American Society of Clinical  Oncology annual meetings and the 2016 and 2017 European  Society for Medical Oncology congresses to identify results of  clinical trials not yet published in full. We applied no other search  parameters. We identified several randomised, phase 3 studies of  patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer treated with  antibodies against programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) or its  ligand PD-L1. The KEYNOTE-024 study showed significantly  longer progression-free and overall survival with pembrolizumab  monotherapy than with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in  patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50% or  greater. The CheckMate 026 study did not show improved overall  survival with nivolumab monotherapy versus platinum-doublet  chemotherapy in the primary population of patients with a  PD-L1 expression level of 5% or greater. The KEYNOTE-189 study  showed that first-line treatment with pembrolizumab plus  platinum-doublet chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall  survival and progression-free survival compared with  chemotherapy alone, irrespective of PD-L1 TPS, in patients with  non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The KEYNOTE-407  study demonstrated similar findings in patients with squamous  non-small-cell lung cancer. The IMpower131 study of  atezolizumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy showed  significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus  platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone in patients with  squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, irrespective of PD-L1  expression. The IMpower150 study showed that the combination  of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy significantly prolonged progression-free and  overall survival in patients with non-squamous non-small-cell  lung cancer, irrespective of PD-L1 expression or EGFR or ALK  genetic alteration status. The CheckMate 227 study showed that  nivolumab plus ipilimumab significantly prolonged  progression-free survival versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy  in patients with a high tumour mutational burden, irrespective  of PD-L1 expression. 
Added value of this study The randomised phase 3 KEYNOTE-042 trial of pembrolizumab  monotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment  enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic  non-small-cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater,  expanding the population of patients compared with that  assessed in the KEYNOTE-024 study. Overall survival was  assessed as the primary endpoint, and we found a significant  survival benefit in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours.  The effect was greatest in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater,  but remained significant in patients with a TPS of 1% or greater.  Despite longer exposure to pembrolizumab treatment than to  chemotherapy, the frequency of treatment-related adverse  events, including those of grade 3 or worse, was lower in the  pembrolizumab group.
Implications of all the available evidence With our findings of a survival benefit and manageable safety  profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy as first-line treatment  in patients with PD-L1-positive, locally advanced or metastatic  non-small-cell lung cancer, we suggest that use of this drug can  be extended to previously untreated patients with a TPS as low  as 1%. In the absence of direct prospective comparisons of  pembrolizumab given alone and in combination with  chemotherapy, patients with PD-L1-positive non-small-cell  lung cancer should discuss the benefits and risks of each  regimen with their physicians when choosing first-line therapy.
targeting ALK alterations.5–7 For patients without driver  oncogenes, however, improve ments in survival were  minimal until  immunotherapeutic options became  available. Pembrolizumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal anti- body against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). The  phase 1 KEYNOTE-0018 and phase 2/3 KEYNOTE-0109  studies established the correlation between increased  expression of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 and benefit from  treatment with pembrolizumab in patients with ad- vanced non-small-cell  lung cancer. KEYNOTE-02410,11  was a phase 3 study that compared pembrolizumab  monotherapy with platinum-based chemotherapy as first- line treatment in 305 patients with metastatic non-small- cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 tumour proportion score  (TPS) of 50% or greater. The primary endpoint of  progression-free survival and the key secondary endpoint 
of overall survival were significantly prolonged in the  pembrolizumab group compared with in the standard  chemo therapy group (median 10·3 months vs 6·0 months  and 30·0 months vs 14·2 months, respectively). In the international, randomised, open-label, phase 3  KEYNOTE-042 study, we compared pembrolizumab  monotherapy with platinum-based chemotherapy as  first-line therapy for patients with locally advanced or  metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 TPS of  1% or greater. Here we report data from the second  interim analysis.

ArticlesColombia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Guatemala, Hungary,  Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru,  Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South  Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan,  Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Patients were  eligible for enrolment if they were aged 18 years or older,  had locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung  cancer without a sensi tising EGFR mutation or ALK  translocation, had at least one measurable lesion according  to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),  version 1.1, had received no previous therapy for locally  advanced or metastatic disease, had an Eastern Cooperative  Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor mance status score of 0  or 1, had life expectancy of 3 months or longer, and had a  PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. We excluded patients if they  had known unstable or untreated central nervous system  metastases, had a history of non-infectious pneumonitis  that required systemic gluco corticoids, had active auto- immune disease, were receiving systemic immuno- suppressive treatment, or had a known active hepatitis B  or C virus infection. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria  are included in the trial protocol (appendix). The protocol and all amendments were approved by the  appropriate ethics committee at each centre. The trial was  done in accordance with the protocol, its amendments,  and the standards of Good Clinical Practice. All patients  provided written informed consent before enrolment.
Randomisation and masking
The randomisation schedule was generated by a com- puterised randomised list generator and held centrally.  Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab  200 mg alone or the investigator’s choice of carboplatin to  achieve an area under the curve of 5–6 mg/mL per min  plus paclitaxel 200 mg/m² or pemetrexed 500 mg/m².  Treatment assignments were obtained via an interactive  voice-response and  integrated web-response system  (Almac Clinical Technologies, Souderton, PA, USA). All  drugs were administered intravenously every 3 weeks.  Randomisation was stratified by region of enrolment (east  Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score  (0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and  PD-L1 TPS (≥50% vs 1–49%), and treatment was allocated  in blocks of four in each stratum. Treatment was open label because the differences  in infusion durations, administration schedules, and  require ments for premedication would have made  masking difficult. Thus, patients, investigators, members  of the external data monitoring committee, and select  representatives of the sponsor were not masked, but the  central radiological reviewers were unaware of treatment  assignment.
Procedures
Treatment was continued until radiographic progression,  the patient developed intolerable toxic effects, the inves- tigator decided to stop treatment, or the patient withdrew 
consent, up to a maximum of 35 cycles in the  pembrolizumab group and for four to six cycles in the  chemotherapy group. Maintenance therapy with peme- trexed 500 mg/m² every 3 weeks was optional but was  encouraged in patients with non-squamous histology  who were allocated to the chemotherapy group. Patients  with radiographic disease progression who were clinically  stable could continue study treatment until progression  was con firmed on a scan obtained at least 4 weeks  later. No crossover from the chemotherapy group to  pembrolizumab was allowed as part of the study. PD-L1 expression was assessed during screening at  two central laboratories (one for China and one for the  rest of the world) with the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx  assay (Agilent Technologies, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and  measured in formalin-fixed tumour samples obtained  by core-needle or excisional biopsy of a tumour lesion  or from tissue resected at or after the time metastatic  disease was diagnosed. Expression was categorised by  TPS, which was defined as the percentage of tumour  cells with membranous PD-L1 staining.12 TPS results  were not revealed to the sponsor, investigator, or site  staff. Radiographic tumour imaging was done at  baseline and scheduled for every 9 weeks for the first  45 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter. Response was  assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 by masked  and independent central review. Adverse events were reported during study treatment  and for 30 days after treatment ended. Serious adverse  events and events of special interest in relation to  pembrolizumab treatment were reported for 90 days after  treatment ended. Adverse events were graded according to  the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. During follow-up,  patients were contacted every 2 months to assess survival.
Outcomes
In the original protocol, written in 2014, the primary  endpoint was overall survival in patients with a PD-L1  TPS of 50% or greater and secondary endpoints were  overall survival in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or  greater and progression-free survival in patients with a  TPS of 50% or greater and of 1% or greater. Exploratory  endpoints were overall and progression-free survival in  patients with a TPS of 1–49% and objective response  among those with a TPS of 50% or greater, 1–49%, and  1% or greater. In 2015, after the enrolment of 662 patients,  a significant overall survival benefit was reported in  patients with previously treated advanced non-small- cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater in  the KEYNOTE-010 study of pembrolizumab versus  docetaxel.9 Consequently, the primary end points in our  study protocol were amended to overall survival in  patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater and of 1% or  greater, and the secondary and exploratory endpoints  were amended to include progression-free survival and  objective response, respec tively, in these populations.

ArticlesApril 2017, after enrolment was complete, we introduced  an intermediate TPS cutoff point. This decision was  based on an analysis of data from KEYNOTE-0109 and  the results of the CheckMate 026 study13 of nivolumab  versus chemotherapy in patients with previously un- treated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and a PD-L1  expression level of 1% or greater. We changed the primary  endpoints to overall survival in patients with a PD-L1 TPS  of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater and  secondary endpoints to progression-free survival and  objective response in these populations. All endpoint  changes were complete before data lock. Safety, a  secondary endpoint since the original protocol, was  assessed by clinical review of adverse events, laboratory  tests, and vital signs in the overall study population  (ie, PD-L1 TPS ≥1%). Duration of response was a  protocol-specified exploratory endpoint. Overall survival was defined as the time from random- isation to death from any cause. Progression-free survival  was defined as the time from randomisation to radio- logically confirmed disease progression or death from any  cause. Objective response was defined as the proportion of  patients with radiologically confirmed complete or partial  response. Duration of response was defined as the time  from first documented complete or partial response to  radiologically confirmed disease progression or death  from any cause. Response and disease progression were  assessed by masked inde pendent central review according  to RECIST version 1.1.
Statistical analysis
Overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective  response were assessed  in  the  intention-to-treat  population, defined as all patients alive at the time of  random allocation to a treatment group. Duration of  response was assessed in all patients who had complete  or partial response. Safety was assessed in the as-treated  population, defined as all randomly allocated patients  who received at least one dose of study treatment. SAS version 9.4 was used for all statistical analyses.  The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall  survival, progression-free survival, and duration of  response. Data for patients who were alive or lost to  follow-up were censored at the time of last contact for  estimation of overall survival. Data for patients without  disease progression or who were lost to follow-up were  censored at the time of last tumour imaging for esti- mation of progression-free survival. Data for patients  who were alive without evidence of disease progression  but who discontinued the study without radiographical  evidence of progression were censored at the time of the  last radiographical assessment showing response. For  progression-free survival and duration of response, data  for patients who started new anticancer therapy without  radiographic evidence of progression were censored at  the time of the last tumour assessment before new  anticancer therapy was initiated.
The stratified  log-rank  test was used  to assess  between-group differences in overall and progression-free  survival. A stratified Cox regression model with Efron’s  method of tie handling14 was used to estimate hazard ratios  (HRs) and associated 95% CIs. The stratified Miettinen  and Nurminen method15 was used to assess between-group  differences in response rate. All randomisation strati- fication factors were applied to all stratified analyses. The evolution of the statistical analysis plan and study  endpoints related to protocol amendments is summarised  in the appendix. The final protocol specified two interim  analyses and a final analysis. The hypotheses of overall  survival and progression-free survival were assessed  sequentially by TPS, in the order of 50% or greater,  20% or greater, and 1% or greater. Hypotheses were  tested only if superiority was established for the  preceding hypothesis. The family-wise type I error was  strictly controlled at a one-sided α of 0·025. Accounting  for the 0·01576 α spent at the first interim analysis, the  superiority boundaries were adjusted for multiplicity  with the Hwang-Shih-DeCani α spending function,16  with the γ parameter set at –0·9023 and an information  fraction of 1166 of 1353 (ie, the numbers of study days to  the second interim analysis and the planned final  analysis, respectively, from the date the first patient was  randomised). Assuming overall survival follows an  exponential distribution with a median of 13 months,17 an  HR for overall survival of 0·65 between the pembro- lizumab and chemotherapy groups among patients with  a TPS of 50% or greater, an en rolment period of  approximately 26 months, a minimum follow-up period  of 19 months after completion of enrolment, and a  dropout rate of 0·003 per month for overall survival,  we calculated that a sample size of approximately  1240 patients would provide the power at the following  levels with a one-sided α of 0·025: 99% to detect an HR  of 0·65 among patients with a TPS of 50% or greater  with 398 deaths in the population; 98% to detect  piecewise HRs of 0·80 from 0 to 6 months of treatment  and 0·64 after 6 months of treatment among patients  with a TPS score of 20% or greater with 557 deaths; and  91% to detect piecewise HRs of 0·92 for 0 to 6 months of  treatment and 0·73 after 6 months of treatment among  patients with a TPS of 1% or greater with 900 deaths.  We used piecewise HRs to account for the possibility of  non-proportional hazards in the treat ment effect of  pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy. The first interim analysis was planned for around  6 months after the final patient was enrolled and was  done using a data cutoff of Aug 30, 2017. After reviewing  results, the external data monitoring committee recom- mended that the study continue as planned. The second  interim analysis was based on a cutoff date of Feb 26, 2018,  and was done 38·3 months after enrolment of the first  patient. The multiplicity-adjusted significance thresholds  are sum marised in the appendix. The external monitoring  committee reviewed the results on April 6, 2018, and

Results
3428 patients across all study sites were screened for  enrolment (figure 1, appendix). 3019 had samples that 
were evaluable  for PD-L1 expression, of whom  1978 (66%)  had a TPS of 1% or greater, including  922 (31%) who had a TPS of 50% or greater. From  Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1275 patients were  randomly allocated to receive pembrolizumab (n=638)  or chemotherapy  (n=637). One patient  in  the  pembrolizumab group was  randomly  assigned  treatment after death and, therefore, the intention-to- treat popluation included 1274 patients (637 in each  group, figure 1). Important protocol deviations, defined  as those that could sub stantially affect the quality or  integrity of key study data or a patient’s rights, safety, or  wellbeing, were reported in 17 (1%) of 1274 patients  (appendix), but only one patient discontinued study  treatment because of a study violation (figure 1).

Table 1: Baseline characteristics
patient demographics and disease char acteristics were  similar between groups and across the TPS populations  at baseline (table 1). At least one dose of study therapy was received by  636 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 615 in  the chemotherapy group (figure 1). The chemotherapy  regimens administered are summarised in the appendix.  Among patients with non-squamous histology in the  chemotherapy group, pemetrexed maintenance therapy  was received by 196, representing 52% of 375 treated  patients, 66% of 296 who completed four cycles of  induction therapy, and 74% of 264 treated patients who  completed four cycles of induction therapy and for whom  pemetrexed maintenance was planned at randomisation. On Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12·8 months  (IQR 6·0–20·0). 87 (14%) of 636 patients who started  pembrolizumab were continuing this treatment, and 
30 (5%) of 615 treated patients in the chemotherapy group  were receiving pemetrexed maintenance therapy (figure 1).  At least one subsequent anticancer therapy was received  by 240 (38%) of 637 patients in the pembrolizumab  group and 282 (44%) of 637 in the chemotherapy group,  including 19 (3%) and 126 (20%), respectively, who  received subsequent immunotherapy (appendix). After  excluding patients still taking pembrolizumab or who had  completed or discontinued treatment without later disease  progression, 240 (51%) of 474 patients in the pembro- lizumab group and 282 (56%) of 504 in the chemotherapy  group received subsequent treatment. 356 patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater  died. Overall survival differed significantly between  groups (figure 2). The median survival duration was  20·0 months (95% CI 15·4–24·9) in the pembrolizumab  group compared with 12·2 months (10·4–14·2) in the

chemotherapy group. 496 patients in the TPS 20% or  greater population died, with the difference in overall  survival remaining significant (figure 2). Median sur- vival was 17·7 months (95% CI 15·3–22·1) in the  pembrolizumab group compared with 13·0 months  (11·6–15·3) in the chemotherapy group. In the TPS 1%  or greater population, 809 patients died and overall  survival was again significantly different (figure 2).  Median survival was 16·7 months (95% CI 13·9–19·7) in  the pembrolizumab group compared with 12·1 months  (11·3–13·3) in the chemotherapy group. The estimated  percentages of patients alive at 24 months in the  pembrolizumab and the chemotherapy groups were  45% and 30%, respectively, in the TPS 50% or greater  population, 41% and 30%  in  the TPS 20% or  greater population, and 39% and 28% in the TPS 1%  or greater population. A survival benefit with pembro- lizumab was evident in most subgroups assessed  (appendix). For never smokers the HRs were 1·00 or  greater, but the 95% CIs overlapped with those of the 
overall population. In a prespecified, exploratory sub- group analysis, overall survival in the TPS 1–49% popu- lation seemed to be similar in the two groups (figure 2).  The median survival values were 13·4 months  (95% CI 10·7–18·2) in the pembrolizumab group and  12·1 months (11·0–14·0) in the chemotherapy group. 1013 patients died or had disease progression in the  PD-L1 TPS 1% or greater population, including 631 in the  TPS 20% or greater population and 454 in the TPS 50%  or greater population. Median progression-free survival  was 7·1 months (95% CI 5·9–9·0) in the pembrolizumab  group and 6·4 months (6·1–6·9) in the chemotherapy  group in the TPS 50% or greater population, 6·2 months  (5·1–7·8) and 6·6 months (6·2–7·3) in the 20% or  greater population, and 5·4 months (4·3–6·2) and  6·5 months (6·3–7·0) in the TPS 1% or greater  population (figure 3). Significance in the TPS 50%  or greater population did not reach the prespecified  superiority boundary and, therefore, was not tested in  the TPS 20% or greater and 1% or greater populations.

In the PD-L1 TPS 50% or greater population, 118 (39%,  95% CI 34–45) of 299 patients in the pembrolizumab  group and 96 (32%, 27–38) of 300 patients in the  chemotherapy group had an objective response to  treatment. The values in the TPS 20% or greater and 1% or  greater populations were 138 (33%, 29–38) of 413 versus  117 (29%, 25–34) of 405 and 174 (27%, 24–31) of 637 versus  169 (27%, 23–30) of 637, respectively (appendix). The  median duration of re sponse was 20·2 months in the  pembrolizumab group in all TPS populations and was  10·8 months, 8·3 months, and 8·3 months, respectively,  in the TPS 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or  greater populations in the chemotherapy group (appendix). In the as-treated population, the median number of  doses administered was nine (range one to 36) in the  pembrolizumab group and six (one to 42) in the chemo- therapy group. Treatment-related adverse events of any  grade occurred in 399 (63%) of 636 patients in the  pembrolizumab group and 553 (90%) of 615 patients  in the chemotherapy group (table 2). Treatment-related  adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity occurred in  113 (18%) of 636 patients in the pembrolizumab group  and 252 (41%) of 615 patients in the chemotherapy  group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in  13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients in the pembrolizumab  and chemotherapy groups, respectively, and treatment  discontinuation in 57 (9%) and 58 (9%), respectively. The  most common treatment-related adverse event was  hypothyroidism (69 [11%] of 636) in the pembrolizumab  group and anaemia (229 [37%] of 615) in the chemo- therapy group (table 2, appendix). Treatment-related  adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity that  occurred in 20 or more patients were pneumonitis in  the pembrolizumab group and anaemia, decreased  neutrophil count, neutropenia, decreased white blood cell  count, and decreased platelet count in the chemotherapy  group (table 2, appendix). Adverse events of interest (events judged likely to be  immune mediated and infusion reactions) occurred in  177 (28%) of 636 patients (51 [8%] grade ≥3) in the  pembrolizumab group and 44 (7%) of 615 patients  (9 [1%] grade ≥3) in the chemotherapy group (table 3).  The only grade 3 or worse immune-mediated events that  occurred in five or more patients in the pembrolizumab  group were pneumonitis, severe skin reactions, and  hepatitis (table 3). One patient in the pembrolizumab  group died because of pneumonitis that occurred  concurrently with disease progression.
Discussion
In this randomised phase 3 study of patients with  previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic  non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR  mut ations or ALK translocations, pembrolizumab mono- therapy significantly prolonged overall survival compared  with standard chemotherapy in patients with a PD-L1  TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater.

Significance was not tested for the 20% or greater and 1% or greater populations because the  prespecified superiority boundary was not met in the 50% or greater population.

Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The events of interest are  infusion reactions and events with an immune-mediated cause regardless of  attribution to treatment by investigators. The events are listed in descending  order of frequency for any grade of adverse event in the pembrolizumab group.  Specific preferred terms and related terms are included.
Table 3: Adverse events of interest in the as-treated population
Pembrolizumab also had a better safety profile than  chemotherapy. Consistent with previous studies of pembrolizumab  given as monotherapy8,9 or as part of combination  therapy18  in patients with metastatic non-small-cell  lung cancer, there appeared to be a relationship between  higher tumour PD-L1 expression and greater efficacy of  pembrolizumab. The HR for overall survival was lowest  in patients who had a TPS of 50% or greater, which might  indicate an increased treatment benefit, but the HR  still favoured pembrolizumab in the TPS 1% or greater  population. In an exploratory analysis of patients with  TPS 1–49%, the 95% CI of the HR for overall survival  crossed 1∙00. Based on the significant survival benefit  observed in the primary TPS 1% or greater population,  along with the safety profile compared with chemotherapy,  pembro lizumab appears to be a reasonable treatment  option for patients with PD-L1-expressing tumours. The median overall survival seen in the pembrolizumab  group in our PD-L1 TPS 50% or greater population is  numerically lower than that reported in KEYNOTE-024,11  although the 95% CIs overlap (20·0 months, 95% CI  15·4–24·9 in KEYNOTE-042 vs 30·0 months, 18·3 to  not reached in KEYNOTE-024). Of note, these studies  enrolled patients in different regions of the world.  KEYNOTE-024 was done mainly in North America and  western Europe, with only 13% of patients enrolled in  east Asia,10 whereas KEYNOTE-042 was done mainly in  Asia-Pacific, eastern Europe, and South America, and  enrolled 29% of patients in east Asia. In the KEYNOTE-042  regions there was less availability of and access to therapy,

Articlesparticularly immunotherapy, which is reflected in the  lower percentage of patients in the chemotherapy group  who received subsequent immunotherapy (20% vs 64%  in KEYNOTE-024), although crossover to pembrolizumab  was permitted during KEYNOTE-024. Progression-free  survival, the primary endpoint of KEYNOTE-024, is less  likely to be affected by crossover than overall survival,  which was the primary endpoint of KEYNOTE-042 and,  thus, why crossover was not permitted KEYNOTE-042.  Even after the results of KEYNOTE-024 showed a benefit  in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater, we chose  not to introduce crossover in KEYNOTE-042. We would  have had to limit crossover to patients with a TPS of  50% or greater because benefit had only been shown in  this population, and crossover would have been allowed  for only part of the trial. Both these factors would  have created challenges for study operation and data  interpretation. Overall, the use of other subsequent  therapies in this study is more representative of real- world clinical practice, where less than half of patients  receive second-line or later treatment.19,20 Pembrolizumab did not significantly prolong pro- gression-free survival in the PD-L1 TPS 50% or greater  population at the time of the second interim analysis, and  per the hierarchical statistical analysis plan, the hypo- theses of progression-free survival in the TPS 20% or  greater and 1% or greater populations were not formally  tested. Although significant progression-free survival  benefits do not always accompany significant overall  survival benefits in studies of immune checkpoint  inhibitors,9,21–24 the absence of this benefit in the TPS 50%  or greater population was somewhat unexpected given  the significant benefit observed in KEYNOTE-024.10 PD-L1  expression was assessed with the same assay and in  the same central laboratory in both studies, and the  distribution of TPS categories across the study popu- lations was similar. The greater heterogeneity of the  KEYNOTE-042 patient population in terms of smoking  history and availability of susequent therapy might  help to explain the discrepant progression-free survival  findings. Based on the recommendation of the external  monitoring committee, the study is continuing to assess  progression-free survival after longer follow-up. In comparison with pembrolizumab in this study,  the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab did not significantly  improve overall survival compared with platinum- doublet chemo therapy in the phase 3 CheckMate 026  study of patients with metastatic or recurrent PD-L1- positive non-small-cell lung cancer.24 In the primary  analysis of CheckMate 026, which included patients with  a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or greater, as determined  using the 28-8 antibody, median overall survival was  14·4 months (95% CI 11·7–17·4) with nivolumab and  13·2 months (10·7–17·1) with chemo therapy, and the  HR was 1·02 (95% CI 0·80–1·30). There was also no  overall survival benefit in the exploratory population of  patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 50% of greater 
(HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·63–1·29). When comparing results  of KEYNOTE-042 and CheckMate 026, it should be noted  that CheckMate 026 permitted crossover after disease  progression, whereas KEYNOTE-042 did not. Overall,  60% of patients in the chemotherapy group received  subsequent nivolumab, which might have decreased the  treatment effect of nivolumab compared with chemo- therapy.13  Findings from the randomised, double-blind, phase 3  KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies17,25 showed that  pembrolizumab in combination with standard-of-care  platinum-doublet chemotherapy signi ficantly prolonged  overall survival and progression-free survival compared  with chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy in patients  with metastatic non-squamous and squamous non-small- cell lung cancer, irrespective of PD-L1 TPS. Although  pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy might have greater  efficacy than pembrolizumab alone in patients with  PD-L1-expressing tumours, particularly in those with lower  PD-L1 expression levels, a definitive conclusion cannot be  made without a prospective direct comparison. Ultimately,  the choice of treatment will need to be determined on an  individual basis after a discussion between the physician  and patient on the risks and benefits of each option and  based on patient-specific factors. The safety profiles for pembrolizumab and chemo- therapy in this study were generally consistent with those  in previous reports,8–10 with no new safety signals identified.  Despite longer treatment exposure in the pembrolizumab  group than in the chemotherapy group, there were fewer  treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse.  Pneumonitis occurred in 8% of patients, but events of  grade 3 or worse severity accounted for less than half  of cases (incidence 3%). Importantly, only one patient  died because of pneumonitis. This patient had multiple  comorbid conditions,  including chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease and bilateral broncho alveolar consoli- dation, as well as disease progression. A limitation of this study is the open-label design,  which probably explains why 22 patients randomised to  the chemotherapy group did not receive chemotherapy  as assigned. These patients might have received immu- notherapy as first-line therapy instead, which could have  decreased the benefit of pembrolizumab compared  with chemotherapy. Another possible limitation of this  study is that only 66% of patients with non-squamous  histology in the chemotherapy group received pemetrexed  maintenance therapy after completing at least four cycles  of platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Despite any concerns  regarding suboptimum therapy in patients with non- squamous histology in the chemotherapy group, the  results were similar to those previously reported for  chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.1,26,27 In conclusion, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy  significantly improved overall survival and was associ ated  with  fewer  treatment-related adverse events  than  platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally

The results of KEYNOTE-042, in which  overall survival was the primary endpoint, confirm the  role of pembrolizumab mono therapy as a standard first- line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer with high  PD-L1 expression and suggest that it is a reasonable  treatment option for patients with lower PD-L1 expression  levels. The study is continuing to evaluate outcomes after  additional follow-up.
