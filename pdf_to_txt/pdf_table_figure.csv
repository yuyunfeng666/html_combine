Responses were assessed in accordance with the RECIST v1.1 by independent review in all 36 patients. Colour code deﬁnes dose level of treatment with SHR-1210. Green, blue, purple bars represent dose levels 60 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg, respectively. The golden pentastar indicates patients with partial response. The red circle indicates patients with progressive disease at the ﬁrst evaluation. The red triangle indicates patients with progressive disease after non-progressive disease. The black star represents the last dose of SHR-1210 patients receive. The black arrow indicates those patients who are still under treatment at the time of data collection ",
